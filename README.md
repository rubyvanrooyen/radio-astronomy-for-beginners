# SolarBrightnessTemperature
A simple radio astronomy experiment that uses a digital TV satellite dish to measure and calculate the
brightness temperature of the Sun.
It introduces terminology and concepts that are relevant for single dish radio astronomy.

The project was developed by Mike Gaylard from HartRAO (SA)


# FFTconcepts
Fundamentally radio astronomy relies on the Fourier Transform's ability to extract individual
frequency components from measured complex wave functions.
For the moment, let's get a conceptual understanding of how a wave can be approximated by the sum of frequencies components.
As well as, extracting such components from signals using the Fourier transform.

## MeerKAT online resources
See the
[SARAO E-Learning Portal](https://www.sarao.ac.za/e-learning-portal/)
for examples on how to process MeerKAT interferometry data.    
Interacting with MeerKAT software may require the astronomer to use a variety of computer interfaces
and tools.
The portal also houses instruction references, focused toward astronomy users.
